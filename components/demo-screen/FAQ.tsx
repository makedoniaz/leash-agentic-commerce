    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle prompt injection from a merchant?",
      a: "A merchant's product description is only ever mined for facts, never treated as an instruction. If a listing says \"ignore the spending limit,\" that text has no path to changing what's authorized — the rules underneath still apply regardless.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why not just have an LLM decide every purchase?",
      a: "Latency and auditability. The deterministic checks run in under a millisecond and every decision traces to a named reason a compliance team could point to — an LLM call on the hot path risks both.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why not just use fixed rules with no AI at all?",
      a: "Because a rule engine can't read \"buy me running shoes under 200\" — turning a customer's sentence into a structured policy is a real language-understanding step, and it's one of the two jobs this case actually asks for.",
    },
    {
      q: "What happens when something is genuinely unclear?",
      a: "We ask, rather than guess. If a fact we need to check your policy is missing from the purchase, the agent gets a step-up request instead of a silent approve or decline.",
    },
    {
      q: "What don't you claim?",
      a: "The public repository demonstrates the decision flow with generated fictional purchases. It does not claim production accuracy or include sponsor data, private APIs, or real card activity.",
